# myFitApp

This app was created using react native and AWS to help fitness enthusiasts track, log, and graph their lifts over time. Users can create an account using their email and a chosen username. Once they are logged in, users can input their lifts for the day, delete any lifts, and even add or delete custom lift names. They are also able to graph a lift over time to see how they are progressing in that exercise.
